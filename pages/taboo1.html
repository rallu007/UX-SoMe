                <h2>How To Play</h2>
                <p>
                    Start from dividing into two teams. One team of boys and one
                    of the girls. Why? Because we will check your knowledge from
                    the terms connected with opposite sex.<br /><br />
                    You draw a word that your other teammates have to guess.
                    Below, there are few other words that you can’t use during
                    explaining the main one. Of course you also can’t use the
                    top one, not the part of that. You have two minutes to guess
                    as much as you can. If it’s going very bad and no one can
                    guess, you can skip to the next card. When the time’s up you
                    can see your result. And then it’s the next team. Easy.
                    Enjoy!
